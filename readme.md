# Number recognition

The first goal of this is to learn image recognition through machine learning techniques.  
    
A recognition rate of over 90% is the goal.  
  
Images and labels have been taken from the [MNIST DATABASE.](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
  
A later goal should be to try and do image recognition, not using any established nn packages but rather basics such as numpy.  
- also to break down the mechanics of neural nets. Convolution, activation functions etc
